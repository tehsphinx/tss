// Package tss is a solution of the `Coding Task 2` by Daimler TSS. It implements
// a Merge function to merge overlapping intervals. MergeP was added to provide a
// pure alternative that doesn't change the input intervals. MergeAlternative was
// an implementation based on a Stack Overflow answer on merging overlapping intervals.
// It was used to improve and compare performance.
